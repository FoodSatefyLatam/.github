This repository hosts an open-source platform designed to enhance food safety and risk assessment in Latin America.
The platform provides seamless access to critical consumption data and food safety calculations for public and experts.
Built on a three-tier architecture, the platform merges comprehensive consumption survey data, anthropometric variables, and contaminant concentrations.
[The backend](https://github.com/FoodSatefyLatam/platform-backend) offers flexible data access through a REST API, while [the frontend](https://github.com/FoodSatefyLatam/platform-backend) provide an interface to visualize, calculate and export  food safety and risk assessment data.

Right now, the platform is using data from the chilean [ENCA 2010](https://www.minsal.cl/sites/default/files/ENCA-INFORME_FINAL.pdf) but more is coming soon.
